# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN's Filters

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It focuses on the use of various CNN filters to identify and classify images into one of ten categories (airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks).

## Features
- Detailed implementation of CNNs using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Exploration of different CNN architectures and filter settings.
- Visualization of CNN layers and filters to understand feature extraction.
- Accuracy and performance evaluation of the models.

## Installation

You need to have Python installed along with TensorFlow, Keras, and other necessary libraries. Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahi4127/CIFAR10-Image-Classification-using-CNN-s-filters.git
cd CIFAR10-Image-Classification-using-CNN-s-filters
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Result
Test Accuracy: The model achieved a test accuracy of 72.02%. This metric demonstrates the effectiveness of the CNN filters in classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
